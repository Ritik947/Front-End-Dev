        <div class="salutation">Respected Sir,</div>

        <div class="main">With due respect, my name is Ritik Gour, a student from Department of Computer Technology, having roll number
            166. I am writing this letter to request permission for attending a workshop organized by Devsnest. <br><br>

            Devsnest is a <em>non-profit</em> organization that aims to create highly skilled individuals by bridging the skill gap
            between colleges' academic curriculum and industry requirements and kick start their careers with good tech
            industry jobs.<br><br>

            They provide a 6-months zero-cost mentorship program for students covering Data structures, Algorithms,
            Backend, and Frontend development via 100+ questions and 10+ Industry grade projects.<br><br>

            Mentors for this initiative are from top tech companies like <em>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft</em>.<br><br>

            The coordinators at Devsnest are conducting a workshop to introduce their mentorship program and explain their
            vision. And, I believe it will be a great learning opportunity for students like me to be guided by highly
            experienced individuals in the field. <br><br>

            This workshop being a really important and integral part of my learning procedures.<br>I request you to consider my
            situation and grant me permission for the same. <br><br>

            Looking forward to your kind consideration.
