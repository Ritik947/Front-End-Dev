    <p>Respected Sir,</p>

    <p>With due respect, my name is Ritik Gour, a student from Department of Computer Technology, having roll number
        166.<br>I am writing this letter to request permission for attending a workshop organized by Devsnest.</p>

    <p>Devsnest is a <em>non-profit</em> organization that aims to create highly skilled individuals by bridging the skill gap
        between colleges' academic curriculum and industry requirements and kick start their careers with good tech
        industry jobs.<br><br>

        They provide a 6-months zero-cost mentorship program for students covering Data structures, Algorithms,
        Backend, and Frontend development via 100+ questions and 10+ Industry grade projects.<br>

        Mentors for this initiative are from top tech companies like <em>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft</em>.</p>

    <p>The coordinators at Devsnest are conducting a workshop to introduce their mentorship program and explain their
        vision. And, I believe it will be a great learning opportunity for students like me to be guided by highly
        experienced individuals in the field.</p>

    <p>This workshop being a really important and integral part of my learning procedures.<br>I request you to consider my
        situation and grant me permission for the same.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>

    <p>
        Yours Sincerely,<br>
        Ritik Gour,<br>
